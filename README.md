Java8 Netbeans project as requested by Todd. I have included the entire project folder in case you wished to import and view the code in netbeans, though of course the code will compile and run from "%extractedFolder%\MarsKitomba\src\marsrovers\"

I would love to answer any questions or hear any feedback - please do not hesitate to contact. 

Kind regards.
